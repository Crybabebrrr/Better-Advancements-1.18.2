Successor to BetterAchievements for the new advancements system in minecraft 1.12+  

Better Advancements tries to improve the UI and UX for the advancements system in minecraft 1.12+ in a modded environment.  

This mod's scope is cosmetic and Quality of Life. For modpack creators, I suggest looking into Triumph if you are creating a pack with custom advancements.

In the future it'll also contain extra features for modders to use, if you are a modder and have a request feel free to make an issue on the tracker.

If you aren't a modder, but have a feature request. Whether it is a visual or functional tweak, feel free to make an issue as well.
